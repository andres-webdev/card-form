## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- React - JS library
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS - For styles
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- Vite

### What I learned

I put in practice the knowledge that I had on React and TypeScript with Test Driven Development for create the components of the app and its test. Besides, I got in deep with TailwindCSS for styles and what are the trade off and trade downs of this tool. At the end of the day, it was simple project to practice and improve my skills.

### Continued development

I'm going to focus my new learning path on use a React Framework, like Next.js or Remix.js, preparing me for the real situations tha I'll have. Also, I'd like to get in deep on unit testing, use other options like Cypress or Vitest.
